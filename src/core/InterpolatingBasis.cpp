/*
 * Overview
 * --------
 * Implementation of the interpolating multiwavelet *scaling* basis setup.
 *
 * The goal of this class is to build a set of polynomials {I_k} such that
 * they are *interpolatory* with respect to a chosen Gaussian quadrature:
 *   • I_k evaluated at quadrature nodes (roots) forms an identity matrix.
 *   • The basis is normalized w.r.t. the quadrature weights.
 *
 * Key ingredients:
 *   - QuadratureCache supplies (roots, weights) for a given quadrature order q.
 *   - LegendrePoly(k, 2.0, 1.0) provides a scaled/shifted Legendre polynomial
 *     of degree k (the exact affine scaling is handled by LegendrePoly).
 *   - Each interpolating basis polynomial I_k is assembled as a linear
 *     combination of Legendre polynomials, then scaled by sqrt(weight_k) so
 *     that the quadrature-induced inner-product is normalized.
 *
 * Data members touched here (belonging to InterpolatingBasis):
 *   - funcs    : vector of Polynomial objects storing the scaling basis {I_k}.
 *   - quadVals : matrix of values of basis at quadrature nodes (made identity).
 *   - cvMap    : diagonal map from coefficient-space → value-space at nodes.
 *   - vcMap    : diagonal map from value-space at nodes → coefficient-space.

/**
 * @brief Build the set of interpolating scaling polynomials {I_k}.
 *
 * Procedure (for quadrature order q and scaling order s):
 *  1) Fetch Gaussian quadrature nodes (roots) and weights (wgts) of order q.
 *  2) Precompute Legendre polynomials L_0, L_1, …, L_{q-1} (scaled/shifted
 *     variant via LegendrePoly(k, 2.0, 1.0)).
 *  3) For each quadrature node k:
 *       a) Start from a copy of L_s (highest degree used for stability).
 *       b) Scale it so that I_k(roots[k]) accumulates the desired unit
 *          contribution. The factor (2*i+1) is the standard Legendre
 *          normalization multiplier that appears in expansions / projections.
 *       c) Accumulate lower-degree Legendre polynomials down to degree 0,
 *          with coefficients proportional to L_i(roots[k]) * (2*i+1).
 *       d) Finally, scale I_k by sqrt(wgts[k]) to make the quadrature-based
 *          normalization diagonal and simple (see calcCVMaps()).
 *  4) Store I_k into this->funcs.
 *
 * Remarks:
 *  - The outer loop is over nodes k, producing one cardinal/interpolatory
 *    polynomial per node.
 *  - The inner loop goes from high to low degree (q-2 … 0). The comment in
 *    the code notes that adding higher-order polys into lower-order ones is
 *    numerically undesirable, hence the chosen order of accumulation.
